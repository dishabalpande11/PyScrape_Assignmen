# PyScrape_Assignment
Problem Statement
Create a Python web scraper which scrapes the following link. 
link = "https://www.mysmartprice.com/mobile/pricelist/samsung-mobile-price-list-in-india.html"

This site lists prices of all Samsung phones in India. The list spans across multiple pages which you would get to by clicking Next at the bottom of the pages. Your goal is to write a scraper which crawls all these pages by programmatically clicking on the Next button and aggregates a list of all phone names and their price.

Output
Your output will be a .csv file in following format:
Phone Name, Price;
Samsung Galaxy A50, 12999;
Samsung Galaxy M30s, 12999;
